        <h2>AIDS Lifecycle (ALC)</h2>
        <p>Last year I joined the ALC ride which is a charity ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The ride consists of 545 miles over 7 days, and has more elevation gain than climbing Mt Everest. The ride takes you across half of California and mainly follows the pacific coast which is absolutely beautiful. In addition to an amazing grand tour ride you are also supporting a great cause, the end of HIV/AIDS. If you are able to, I am of course, raising funds for this year's event so please consider<a href="http://www.tofighthiv.org/site/TR/Events/AIDSLifeCycleCenter?px=3448545&pg=personal&fr_id=2180">Donating Today.</a></p>

        <p>Here is the day 7 route from ALC 2019, ending in Los Angeles</p>

        <p>Many of the days on the ride are similar to this one and mialages normally range from 60 to 100 miles per day (100 to 160km). The elevations can be drastically different if you are riding along the coast vs inland, and the transition between the two often involves climbing over some coastal cliff. A great thing about the ALC is that it is a very well supported ride and there is noramlly a water and snack station every 20 miles so you can take a break from the saddles and you do not need to carry too many supplies in you jersey.</p>

        <p>Of course, hills in California are nothing compared to here in Colombia! I am so excited (and sore) from my first few rides here. I am really looking forward to training on the long climbs of the Andes and would love to work up to taking on <a href="https://www.thomsonbiketours.com/blog/2018/05/16/alto-de-letras-perfectly-colombian/">Alto de Letras</a></p>

        <p>Here is a recent ride on mountain bikes here in Medellin, climbing up Parque Cerro El Volador</p>
