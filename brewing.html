 <h1>Who doesn't love a good beer?</h1>
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is brewing beer, and I love to share and get feedback from friends and other brewers. Much like cooking and baking the joy in brewing is sharing, both on brew day and really on tasting days. Being able to kick back with friends and have a few beers that you brewed is really a great experience.</p>

        <h2>Recent Brews</h2>
        <h3>Blue Moon Clone</h3>
          <p>For this brew, done in Jan 2019, I used a Blue Moon clone kit but I doubled up on the marmalade for extra oranginess. The result was a bit like a wheat sour as the orange flavor is strong but a bit tart. Over all it was well received and with 5 gallons I had pleny to bottle for picnics all summer long!</p>

        <h3>Belgian Dubbel</h3>
          <p>For this brew, November 2018, I used a Chimmay Red kit to brew just over 10 gallons. This was the first time using my new brew pot and a new type of belgian yeast. The results were a very nice banana bread aroma and a very drinkable beer for 9.1% ABV. The beer did turn out a bit sweet and I think a bit more time fermenting to clean up residual sugars could have been beneficial. I'll age a few bottles for a year and see how they turn out.</p>

        <h3>Orange Blossom Mead</h3>
          <p>I also recently brewed my first Mead, or honey wine. Mead is just as simple as beer in that all you are really doing it making sugar water and then letting yeast have a buffet until most of the sugar is converted to alcohol. The difference with mead is that instead of extracting the sugar from grains you are using honey. For my first mead I followed a traditional recipie and added cinimon and orange peel to the fermenter, and I used a champaign style yeast to give it a bit of sparkle.</p>
