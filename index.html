      <h1>Let's Do This!</h1>
      <article>
      	<h2>Hi I'm Tim</h2>
          <p>Hey there Holberton, I'm excited to be taking the next step towards a career in engineering.</p>

      		<p>I am originally from Michigan USA, and grew up in Ypsilanti a small town about half an hour's drive from Detroit. More recently I've called Oakland California home. The header image at the top of the page is actually of Lake Merritt the estuary in the heart of Oakland. The lake is the oldest bird sanctuary in America, and is a crown jewel in the town. On Sundays hundreds of families come down to the lake and picnic in the park. There is food, live music, street preformers, tons of classic cars and tricked out scrapper bicycles. It's everyone's backyard and such a great place to see the whole community enjoying the weekend!

        <h3>Nomadic Moves</h3>
          <p>Currently I am on the road for at least the next several months in South American with my first stop being Medellin Colombia. The plan is to spend a few months in Medellin, the Bogata, then Quito, La Paz, Santiago, Patagonia, Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Sao Paulo, and Rio. Time tables may shift if this coding school application works out, but either way life is an adventure so get going!</p>

  		  <h4>A tad more on me...</h4>
      		<p>I love cycling, baking treats, brewing beer, and spending time in nature. I'll share a bit more about these passions with you through this project website. Have a look around and let me know what you think in the discus comments. 

          Finally I am excited to be applying to Holberton here in Colombia and the opportunity to take on another big adventure. See you around!</p>
